### 🗓️ Project Duration
Dec 2023 - Dec 2023

<br>

### 🔍 Key Features

#### 📂 Data Columns
- Date: Date of the recorded visits <br>
- Visits: Number of visits on the given date <br>

#### 🛠️ Data Analysis Steps
##### 📦 Import Libraries:
- pandas: Used for data manipulation, reading CSV files, creating DataFrames, handling missing values, etc. <br>
- matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating various plots and visualizations like line charts, scatter plots, etc. <br>
- plotly.express: Optional library for creating interactive visualizations like scatter plots, heatmaps, etc. <br>
- plotly.graph_objects: Optional library for creating more complex and customizable plotly visualizations. <br>
- statsmodels.tsa.seasonal: Used for performing seasonal decomposition on time series data to separate trend, seasonal component, and remainder. <br>
- statsmodels.tsa.arima_model: Used for building and fitting ARIMA models for time series forecasting. <br>
- statsmodels.api: Used for various statistical functions and model fitting in statsmodels. <br>

##### 🧹 Data Collection and Cleaning:
- Load website traffic data from a CSV file. <br>
- Check for missing values and remove them. <br>
- Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format and set it as the index. <br>

##### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the daily website visits to identify trends and patterns. <br>

##### 📈 Seasonal Decomposition:
- Perform seasonal decomposition on the 'Visits' column to separate trend, seasonal component, and remainder. <br>

##### 🧠 Model Building:
- Define ARIMA model parameters and create a SARIMAX model for time series forecasting. <br>
- Fit the model to the data and print a summary of the fitted model. <br>

##### 📊 Forecasting and Visualization:
- Generate predictions for the next 50 days after the end of the data. <br>
- Plot the actual visits (training data) and predicted visits. <br>
